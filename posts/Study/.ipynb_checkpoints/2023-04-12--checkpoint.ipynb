    "In this section, we propose a procedure using STGCN by coupling a concept of self-consistency (Tarpey and Flury, 1996; Lee and Meng, 2005) and a thresholding of periodogram by Emperical beyes Thresholding. First, we consider the\n",
    "self-consistency principle for estimating(or forecasting) when facing missing data. Tarpey and Flury (1996) introduced the self-consistency as a fundamental concept in statistics, which is inspired by Hastie and Stuetzle (1989) for developing principal curves. Further, Lee and Meng (2007) considered a self-consistent regression estimator with incomplete data. They proposed an estimate $\\hat{f}$ of the underlying obs function $f$ given observed data $x_{obs}$ that is the solution of the following self-consistent equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\hat{f}_{com} | x_{obs}, f = \\hat{f}_{obs}) = \\hat{f}_{obs}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{f}$ denotes an estimate of $f$ based on the hypothetical complete data $x_{com} = (x_{obs},x_{mis})$ and $x_{mis}$ is missing data, and $E(·)$ denotes the expectation operator. We note that $x_{mis}$ is not available in practice. Moreover, Lee and Meng (2007) suggested that the above equation provides a way to obtain a “best” incomplete-data estimator $\\hat{f}$ by simply using the corresponding obs complete-data procedure that computes $\\hat{f}$. By considering that the above equation does not depend on the method for estimation, it can be applicable for STGCN procedure with missing data.  In practice, the missing values $\\{ f(n) : n \\in M \\}$ are not available, and thus, given imputed values $\\{ \\tilde{f}(n) : n \\in M \\}$, we obtain an estimated complete dataset $\\{ \\hat{f}(n)\\} = \\{ f(n) : n \\in O \\} \\cup \\{ \\tilde{f}(n) : n \\in M \\}$.\n",

    "A simple and fasr way to implement that may be an interactive algorithm with updating $\\{ \\tilde{f}^{(l)} (n) : n \\in M \\}$ by STGCN."
